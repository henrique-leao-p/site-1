                <b>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</b> is the third and final installment in the series of games developed by
                CD PROJEKT RED featuring the witcher Geralt of Rivia. The game was originally scheduled for release in late 2014, then
                pushed back to 24 February 2015, and finally released on 19 May 2015. During the first two weeks since release
                it
                had sold more than 4 million copies worldwide, more than doubling the total sales of its predecessor,
                The
                Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.
            </p>
            <p class="the-witcher-3">
                Unlike the previous games, The Witcher 3 is set in a multi-region open world, featuring over 100 hours
                of
                content. Several early articles mentioned that the developers planned to have an open world similar to
                that
                of Skyrim, but 20% larger. The developers were quick to point out that while there was much to
                appreciate
                in Bethesda's open world concept, they were also making an effort not to repeat what they perceived as
                the flaws
                in-game. As with earlier games, the consequences of Geralt's actions will impact how the narrative
                progresses.
                The game has been built using the new REDengine 3 and was designed with player feedback from fans of
                previous
                Witcher games in mind.

                For fans of the series, the online event "Killing Monsters", a weekly giveaway of wallpapers and audio
                files
                that ran from 10 June 2013 to 14 August 2013, culminated in the release of the "Killing Monsters"
                cinematic
                trailer.

            <p class="the-witcher-3">
                On 14 May 2015, CD PROJEKT RED (working with Digic Pictures) released a pre-launch short story trailer
                titled "A
                Night to Remember".

            <p class="the-witcher-3">
                On September 4, 2020, it was announced that the game and its expansions would be getting a
                next-generation
                upgrade and would be released as a standalone purchase for the next-generation consoles (Xbox Series X
                and
                PlayStation 5) as well as PC. A free update will be given out to those who already own the game on the
                PC, Xbox
                One, and PlayStation 4. While it was originally expected to be released in 2021 it was later announced
                that the next-generation update had been delayed to 2022 before CDPR announced it'd be released on
                December
                14, 2022.

                For the main article, see The Witcher 3 storyline.
                The world is in chaos. The air is thick with tension and the smoke of burnt villages. The fearsome
                Empire of
                Nilfgaard has struck again, ravaging the helpless Northern Kingdoms. The once mighty who tried to use
                Geralt for
                their own gain are now gone. In these uncertain times, no one can say what fortune holds in store, who
                will bring
                peace to the world and who will cause it only misery. But a force darker and deadlier emerges.
            </p>
            <p class="the-witcher-3">
                The petty men and women commanding tin-plated armies fail to understand that their conflict is child's
                play compared
                to the Wild Hunt, the otherworldly threat which now looms. These ghastly spectral riders have for ages
                plagued
                humankind, bringing misery to the world. This time the Wild Hunt seeks one person in particular: the one
                individual
                Destiny itself bestowed upon Geralt, the one soul Geralt considers kin.
